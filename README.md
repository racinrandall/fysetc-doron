# Build Notes for the Fysetc Doron Velta kit

I decided to build a Doron Velta from the [Fysetc kit](https://www.fysetc.com/products/3d-printer-doron-velta?_pos=1&_sid=952f69bd9&_ss=r), simply because they had a coupon code that brought the price down to around $380 USD shipped.

For printed parts I used the [Fabreeko Github](https://github.com/Fabreeko/Doron-Velta/tree/main) as they have the files named for if they are primary or accent colors, gives the option of using 2 accent colors.

As I didn't find a build guide similar to the ones for Vorons, I am primarily using this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-V6F0aNnRW4).  As I started installing the heat set inserts, I noticed the Effector is different in the parts I printed than the one used in this video.  The video uses heat sets for where the rods attach, whereas the one I printed uses captured nuts.  My initial thought is it appears that the captured nuts would be square nuts, but I did not find any in the kit.  When I get to that part of the build, I will verify if it in fact needs square nuts, and if the nuts are provided or not.

The video only shows placing heat set inserts in two of the skirts, however all skirts had places for heat set inserts.  There were not enough 3mm heat set inserts to put them in all of the skirts.  The Effector and the printed part for Klicky use 2mm heat set inserts and there appears to be more than enough of those.

Speaking of the heat set inserts, I didn't notice a heat set insert tool in the kit.  [Here](extras.md) is a listing of all the things I purchased or used in addition to the Fysetc kit to complete my build.

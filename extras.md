# Extras purchased

Below you will find all of the items I purchased for this build.  Some of the items (tools) I already had, but including links to give a complete idea of what is used/needed for this build.

## Tools I used for this build
[Heat Set Insert Tool](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B17VQLD?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_3) Makes doing heat set inserts easier than a pencil tip soldering iron

[Weller SP40NKUS](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B3SG7F0?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_3&th=1) Used for the above heat set insert tools

[Fabreeko Precision Hex Drivers](https://www.fabreeko.com/collections/tools/products/fabreeko-precision-screw-driver-set-of-5) I have these and some from another company that are exactly the same.  I've used them on most of my printers and have used the other brand ones on my RC cars for years.
